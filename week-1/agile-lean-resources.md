## Lean (Build, Measure, Learn)

### [Minimum Viable Product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)

- valuable (solves at least one problem / accomplishes at least one goal for the user)
- usable (user can figure out how to use it with little effort)
- feasible (it can be built within the constraints of the team)

#### Process to Determine MVP

- brainstorm "user stories" ([purpose], actor, action)
- prioritize them
- draw a line beneath the minimum set that adds value
