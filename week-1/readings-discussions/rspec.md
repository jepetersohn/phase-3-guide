- [Testing terminology and a FAQ](https://gist.github.com/edshadi/5706868) so that you can wrap your head around things.
- [Hereâ€™s a quick example of how Rspec is used to test code](https://gist.github.com/abinoda/1a0778292dd0aa0cd380).
- Please [Explore Rspec syntax](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/). In particular, try to familiarize yourself with the basic structure of rspec, hooks, subject, built-in matchers, custom matchers, mocks, and rspec with rails. You'll find documentation on each of these topics.
- Study [this app and test example](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/awesomebits). This code base was developed by Thoughbot, they are the creators of 2 popular gems used in testing ([shoulda](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda) and [factory girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails)). It's a good place to see how the creator of the gems intended to use them.
```ruby
1000.times { puts "please do not copy and paste, you'll be hurting yourself." } 
```

For tomorrow, please have written an Rspec test with at least 3 passing examples for a Ruby class of your choice (feel free to pick something from your Phase 1 exercises, or from today's challenge).
