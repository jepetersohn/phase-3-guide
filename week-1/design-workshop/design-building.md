## Design Building

- Working with Rails views.
- Using Sass.
- Choosing to use (or not) a CSS framework.
- Responsive design.

### Rails views

- Have a strong, semantic markup structure.
- Presentation (CSS) and behavior (JS) should be separate.
- Complex logic should be somewhere else.
- Partials are your friends.

### Sass

- CSS with superpowers
  - [Sass Basics](http://sass-lang.com/guide)
  - [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
  - [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/)
  - [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/)
  - [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/)

### Frameworks

- Things to consider about frameworks:
  - Do I know how this works?
  - Does this affect performance?
  - What's the cost of retroactive customization vs. building custom from scratch?
  - Will a smaller tool serve my purpose?
