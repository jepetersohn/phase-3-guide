## Your Tasks

### 1 - Analyze
(30 mins)
With your group, decide what the personality of your site.

In pairs, find 2 websites that you both really like (both
funtionality/content and visually) and answer the following questions:

**Functionality**
* What about this site is easy to use?
* Is the functionality the same on different devices, browsers, and
monitors sizes?
* Where is the navigation? Is it clear?
* How do you login and sign up? Do the links stand out?
* What does the website creator want you to do?

**Visual**
* What do you like about the site visually?
* What are the colors for: background, text, links, headers, navigation,
primary/pop color
* What are the fonts and sizes for: text, links, headers, navigation,
buttons
* When you take a step back what stands out?
* Where is the first place your eyes look?
* How many clicks/pages before you get to what you want to do?

**Code**
Using the inspector, take a look at the code.
* Is it organized well?
* Is it using semantic HTML5?
* How are the CSS classes named?

**Describe the site's personality**

### 2 - Create a visual styleguide

Create a single HTML page and a single CSS file.

First, choose your styles for:
- Primary color
- Background color
- Text color and variations (i.e. shades of gray or brown)
- Link color
- Success, Error, Info colors (i.e. Good, Bad, Info)
- Display font
- Text font
- Base font size and small, medium, large and x-large
- Grid (try Unsemantic or Simple-Grid)
- Buttons
- Navigation bar

Following the format of Google's [Styleguide](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/resources/styleguide/), create an HTML page with a header and an element showing the style as well as a code snippet for using the style.

For example,

```html
<h2>Colors</h2>
<h3>Primary Color</h3>
<div class="styleguide-color primary-color-bg"></div>
<p>To use:</p>
<pre>
  <div class="primary-color-bg">This is a div with the primary color as background</div>
  <div class="primary-color">This is a div with the primary color as text</div>
</pre>
```

Create a css file with the styles for your visual styleguide.

### 3 - Prototype with Rails

Go to the [Design Challenge](../../../../../design-challenge/).  

You will first wireframe your website. 
Then using SASS
