## Tutorials, videos, & notes
* Watch [Intro to Rails
lecture](https://talks.devbootcamp.com/2014-coyotes-intro-to-rails)
* Go through code school's [Rails for Zombies redux](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-for-zombies-redux) and [Rails for Zombies 2](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-for-zombies-2). Some of it might be repetitive, just skip/skim. The main focus today is to expose yourselves to as many Rails 'things' as possible. Tomorrow we start building.
