# Microchallenge: Persisting Data

## Overview

By now you've discovered how much fun client-side applications are! We've been going hard at writing object-oriented Javascript code along with Jasmine tests, but there's one problem with our application that we haven't yet addressed...

What if the user wants to save the state of the application so they can close their browser and come back to it later?

## Challenge

In this micro-challenge you will make your applications persistent by adding asynchronous XMLHTTPRequest's to your models that will send data to an API you develop so that you can save data. What web framework and database you use is up to you. I think Sinatra + Redis would be awesome! For this challenge please don't worry about handling multiple users/session.
