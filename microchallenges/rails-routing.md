# Microchallenge:  Rails Routing

## Overview
This micro-challenge will help reinforce your understanding of Rails routing.  In order to attempt this challenge you'll need at least one `resources` route along with some CRUD functionality reliant on it (eg. `resources :questions`).

When you're ready, begin by creating a new feature branch of the app you started building today. Name the branch whatever you'd like because we'll be throwing it away once we're done with this challenge.

## Challenge
Comment out the most used resources route from your routes file.  Now, by only editing the routes file, write custom routes so that your app functions just as it did before you commented out the resource.  The microchallenge is complete when the app works.
