# Sinatra To Rails

## Learning Competencies
- Identify the differences between Sinatra and Rails.
- Implement a solved problem (something that you've solved/done before) in different frameworks.
- Familiarity with Rails moving parts and the 'Rails way'.

## Summary

Pick *one* of the following three Sinatra-based challenges from Phase 2 and build it in Rails:

1. Craigslist, Jr.
2. Sinatra URL Shortener
3. Hacker News Clone

Focus first and foremost on doing things the "Rails way."  Rails' idiomatic style can be frustrating coming from simpler, more explicit frameworks like Sinatra, but the sooner you [grok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) how Rails sees the world the more productive you'll be.

## Objectives

If you need a specific area to focus on, [Rails form helpers](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html) are a great place to start.  Form helpers are the collection of view helpers that Rails uses to generate, manipulate, and submit forms.
