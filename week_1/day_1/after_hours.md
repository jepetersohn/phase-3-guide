# Monday After Hours Work

Please keep on pushing forward with your Rails apps. Make sure you've practiced the topics I sent out this morning and familiarized yourself with the Rails guides.

Tomorrow we'll be diving into automated testing -- the art of using computer programs to test your code rather than manual human labor. The driver code you've become accustomed to writing since Phase 1 is actually a form of automated testing. The driver code runs through your methods and helps ensure that they generally execute and return results as you would expect.

We’ll be learning about Rspec, the samurai sword of Ruby/Rails automated testing.

Here’s a quick example of how Rspec is used to test code: https://gist.github.com/abinoda/1a0778292dd0aa0cd380

Here's a brief overview of some Rspec testing terms and features: https://gist.github.com/abinoda/5859830

Please study the Rspec syntax: https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/ In particular, try to familiarize yourself with the basic structure of rspec, hooks, subject, built-in matchers, custom matchers, mocks, and rspec with rails. You'll find documentation on each of these topics.

**For tomorrow, please have written an Rspec test with at least 3 passing examples for a bare Ruby class of your choice (feel free to pick something from your Phase 1 exercises).**

Here are a three resources to keep on hand throughout the rest of the phase:

- Rspec Cheat Sheet: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/598519/Rspec%20Cheatsheet.pdf
- Rspec Best Practices: https://github.com/abinoda/rspec-best-practices
- Rails/Rspec example code: https://github.com/awesomefoundation/awesomebits/tree/master/spec
