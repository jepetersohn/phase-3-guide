# Rails and AJAX

This micro-challenge will help you brush up on AJAX and get practice using it in Rails.

Create a new feature branch and AJAXify one of your forms. Good candidates include voting (if you're far enough in), commenting, posting answers, and signup.

Make the user experience spectacular. You should think through decisions such as:

how will you handle invalid input or errors?
do you want the server to return json or html?

Please submit your solution via pull request to your project repo (not the guide).
