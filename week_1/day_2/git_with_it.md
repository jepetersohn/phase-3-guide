# Git With It

Thanks for your hard work today. We are going to keep you guys going this evening with a Git challenge Abi recently created. This challenge will take you through a tour of Git techniques that will be invaluable as we move into team projects, and even more important as you graduate DBC and transition into professional teams.

The instructions are posted here:
https://gist.github.com/abinoda/82c4be1579cb06c15f79

There is an accompanying repository and pull request (the link is in the gist instructions).

Help each other through. Ask staff for help.

We'll kick off tomorrow with an overview of Agile before diving into our group projects.
