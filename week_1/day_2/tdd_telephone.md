# TDD Telephone Instructions

** Note - the entire cohort will be working on this at the same time.**

1. Create a Github repository for you and your partner
2. Add yourselves AND the other pair as collaborators to your repository
  - You will be assigned another pair to collaborate with.
  - You and your other pair will be assigned a room in HipChat.
5. Setup Github hooks so that you don't need to manually notify the other team each time you push new code: http://help.hipchat.com/knowledgebase/articles/64389-github-integration  
  - Your API token is: 69ca1e859b1a3f2fcb0d8965e9a68c  
6. You will be privately given an exercise for your pair. Follow the instructions in that gist.
