### Custom Routes

This micro-challenge will help reinforce your understanding of Rails routing.

In order to attempt this challenge you'll need at least one `resources` route along with some CRUD functionality reliant on it.

When you're ready, begin by creating a new feature branch of the app you started building today. Call it whatever you'd like because we'll be throwing it away once we're done with this challenge.

I'd like you to comment out your most used resources route (eg. resources :questions) from your routes file. Now, without touching any other files of your app, write custom routes so that your app functions just as it did with your resources route.
