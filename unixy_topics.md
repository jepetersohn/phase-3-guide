# Unixy Lightning Talks

We want to make sure you understand the tools you've been using these last few
weeks.  Developers who show familiarity and facility in the Unix environment
"signal" that they have a multi-level understanding of their development
environment.  Failure to demonstrate a certain level of comfort is a negative
signal.
