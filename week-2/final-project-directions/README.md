# Teaching Directions for Final Project

## What we're looking for

1.  We will evaluate the quality of your code in terms of the coverage that's
provided by your tests.  We will use the following tests to find vulnerable
areas and then we will beat up the vulnerable parts to try to find breaks.  We
will use the following tools:
  1.  [Flog](https://github.com/seattlerb/flog)
  1.  [Simplecov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov)
1.  Doing a front-end (mostly) app does not absolve you of testing.  If you
take this approach we expect to see Jasmine tests
1.  Simplicity
  1.  Templates
  1.  Controller methods (brief!)
  1.  Classes: SOLID
1.  Cross-team competence:  do not have a "testing guy" or a "front-end gal".
You team should be conversant on the **team's** code
* Proper use of ActiveRecord (esp. associations)
* MVC OO JS (wehre appropriate)

## What we want to provide

1.  Support for team leads (and team members!) to help keep interpersonal
conflict and friction at a minmum
1.  Tips in constructing and advancing your debugging process

## Specific Problems

* [N+1](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#eager-loading-associations)

## Consultation

We will be available to consult with your team.  Have questions ready for us.
If you don't we will use those as free time to explore / mangle / flog your
code.  Friday and Tuesday will be consultation days.

## MVP

Will be presented on Monday and will be reviewed by the teachers on the same
day.

## Feature Freeze

Tuesday at midnightl
