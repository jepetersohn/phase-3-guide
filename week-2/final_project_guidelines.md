# Final Project Guidelines

## Purpose

While we do our best to make our challenges focused, relevant, and fun, nothing will prepare you for the real world like creating and implementing a project of your own design.  It's an opportunity to focus on things that you never _quite_ got during your education here. It's also an opportunity to try how the meta-learning you've grown in while here can help you learn new technologies.  It's a chance to share a passion and ask for help in realizing it.

This project is important.  It reflects the culmination of the last 18 weeks at DBC.  Nevertheless, it is only a project, you should never feel compelled to harm you health or well-being in the pursuit of this project.  Here are some guidelines.

## Don't Deplete Your Hit Points

Use the Github Graphs Timecard graph.  It will show you when you're working.  You should have your "black dots" between reasonable time hours.  When you work outside of reasonable hours you're throwing brute force at the problem. Don't do this.  Ask better questions.  Focus your debuging, but don't sit there plugging away at the same inefficient strategy.

## Don't Abuse Chemicals

I've overheard in several final projects that students were abusing Adderall to get through the final project. In no circumstance should you follow this technique.  If it's prescribed to you by a licensed medical pratcitioner, fine; but you should not **ab**use pharmacology in the pursuit of your goals.

## Do Ask for Help When Interpersonal Conflict Is Unmanageable

Your instructors have seen projects encounter, survive, and move past interpersonal worries.  Do not keep these concerns to yourself, reach out to us.
