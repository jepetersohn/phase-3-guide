## Introduction

Huzzah! You've made it to Phase 3. I hope you're ready, because we're going to
dive *head first* into a sea of technologies and methodologies to help you grow
personally as a developer and as quality team member.

This phase is incredibly tight and you're going to feel very stretched right up
until graduation day. Be ready to give your all as you push towards demo day.
You'll get the most out of this if you stay curious, hold yourself and your
peers to **high standards** and most importantly **support those around you.**

Alyssa and I will be treating you like *professional developers*. We'll be
placing high value on quality code and great teamwork over quantity. By now
your ability to teach yourself should be on that superpower level, and we'll be
expecting you to use it and share the juicy fruits with everyone else in the
cohort.

Over the next three weeks you're going to be developing habits that will serve
you for the rest of your career.

Hold on to your butts.

## Overview

* Challenges will be bigger and more vague. A lot of the problem will be how strategizing how to approach the problem: like debugging or researching a problem.
* Most evenings will have prep work for the next day or micro-challenges that are 100% mandatory.
* When not on group projects, morning lectures will introduce context for the day's work.
* Alyssa and Ryan will perform code reviews of select challenges. We will be critical and opinionated as we would of coworker's code.
* We expect you to submit only 100% peer-reviewed code to your projects using a pull-request Git workflow.
* Yoga on Thursday's at 9:00am is mandatory except during final projects.
