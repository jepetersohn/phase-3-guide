## Introduction

Congratulations! You've made it to Phase 3. We're going to
dive *head first* into a sea of technologies and methodologies to help you grow as a
web developer and as high-functioning team member.

This phase is incredibly demanding and you'll feel very stretched right up
until graduation day. Be ready to give your all as you push towards demo day.
You'll get the most out of this if you stay curious, hold yourself and your
peers to **high standards** and most importantly **support those around you**.

In this phase we no longer view you as students or developers-in-training, rather we look at you to be valuable, albeit junior, collaborators in the craft of software development. This will define how we interact and how we assign and tackle challenges. Similarly, and you should no longer think of yourselves as "classmates" but rather "teammates" or "coworkers."

We will be treating you like **professional developers**. We
place more value on quality code and great teamwork than on quantity of features.
By now your ability to teach yourself should be at a high level, and we'll be
expecting you to use it and share the fruits of your learning with everyone in the
cohort.

Over the next three weeks you're going to be developing habits that will serve
you for the rest of your career.

## Challenges

- Code quality is #1.
- Challenges will be bigger and more vague. A lot of the problem will be how strategizing how to approach the problem: like debugging or researching a problem.
- The emphasis of challenges is on the process of problem solving, not the
  solution.  _We expect that you can complete any challenge at this point.  HOW
you complete it is at stake_.

## Rails

Rails is a powerful tool.  While you've had to write and re-write the same
boilerplate code dozens of times in Sinatra skeleton, Rails will make it
**much** easier to get up and running and take the boilerplate away.

That said, Rails can become _too_ "zealous" in its code generation.  While we
bless your *exploration* of the powers of `rails generate` **do not use it** in
these challenges.  The ability to write Rails code (models, controllers, and
views) from a blank editor screen is a skill you need to develop.  An
interviewer will be none-too-impressed if your ability to write a controller is
hamstrung by access to the Rails generators.

**EXCEPTION**:  You may feel free to `rails generate migration`.  Why?  Because
figuring out time-stamps is irritating.

**EXCEPTION**:  You may also use the generators that are required to get RSpec
installed.  Why?  Because coordinating dependencies of a third-party gem that's
used for testing is difficult.

## Feedback

Don't be attached to your code, our job is to be critical and opinionated :)
Occasionally a criticism will be reducible to a question of style.  Both of us
are professional Rails developers.  We may occasionally give you guidance that
is justified by "that's not idiomatic Rails."  That's "taste" and while we hope
you have acquired some sense of it in the previous phases, we will try to help
you further refine it during our time together.

### On Feedback Style

In Phase 3, part of our goal is to debug your thought process.  If you say you
are weak, we will give you exercises.  If you give us a bad process, we will ask
you to find your own weakness.  If you criticise the challenges we give you, we
will make you fix them.  If you complain that something "doesn't work" we will
ask you to explain what you've done to understand the problem.

In short, we're going to ask you to be completely **responsible**.  Lamentably
this expectation seems to have gone out of fashion these days, but that is not
the case here.

## De Sententiis (On Opinions)

When someone gives you an observation, it is your obligation to hold them
accountable to that opinion.  When an alumnus comes along and says "ERB sucks,
HAML is the bomb" it is your **job** to ask that individiual:  "Wombat Salar,
why do you say this?  What problem does this solve?  What companies are using
this?  Who are the main contributors on this?  What's their philosophy?  What's
the point of view behind this thing?"

While it's important to leave your mind open for input, it's also important to
know when you need *not* heed some advice.  As Kipling says in "If:"

    If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
        But make allowance for their doubting too;...
    Yours is the Earth and everything thatâ€™s in it

## Conclusion

- Don't burn out, take care of each other.
- This is a no-shame ask-anything environment.
- All our challenge solutions/repos should be under phase organization.
- Make sure you check out [Phase 3 Git

Process](./group_project_process.md)
