## Introduction

Congratulations! You've made it to Phase 3. We're going to
dive *head first* into a sea of technologies and methodologies to help you grow as a
web developer and as high-functioning team member.

This phase is incredibly demanding and you'll feel very stretched right up
until graduation day. Be ready to give your all as you push towards demo day.
You'll get the most out of this if you stay curious, hold yourself and your
peers to **high standards** and most importantly **support those around you**.

## Learning Goals

In phase one, you learned how to program. In phase two, you learned how
the internet works. In this phase, you'll learn how to be
**professional developers**. To do so, we'll be focusing on the following topics:

_*Architecting, not just building*_. At this point in the program, we expect that you can solve any problem we put in front of you. What matters now is how you solve it. Your job is to build codebases that are elegant, well-organized, and the result of conscious design decisions. Much of this phase will be spent discussing how to best structure your codebase on the server and on the client.

_*Building maintainable code*_. Your code will be judged not by its novelty and cleverness, but by its longevity – any developer can 'get it working.' Great developers focus on building tools that will last. Our focus in this phase is on maintainability – this includes testing, of course, but also readability, documentation, version control, and system design. In three weeks, you will sell yourself as someone who can be trusted to write production code. Your job in this phase is to make that a reality.

_*Learning with intention*_. When you graduate from Dev Bootcmap, your value isn't what you know. Its how you learn. Can you learn new tools quickly, and utilize them well? Can you seek out and decipher documentation on your own? Can you ask for and recieve help when you need it? These are the behaviors of great developers, and you should start practicing them now. You will all learn the complex Rails API over the next few weeks, and likely a half dozen others throughout your final project.

By the end of this phase, you will be a junior developer. We don't expect you to produce beautiful code on your first try, one your second try, or even your tenth. We expect that you will be able to recognize patterns and behaviors, and formulate intelligent opinions on them. We expect that you will learn new tools and methodologies with confidence and speed. We expect that you will push yourself to live up to these standards, and, eventually, build beautiful and meaningful things.

## On Rails

Rails is a powerful tool.  While you've had to write and re-write the same
boilerplate code dozens of times in Sinatra skeleton, Rails will make it
**much** easier to get up and running and take the boilerplate away.

That said, Rails can become _too_ "zealous" in its code generation.  While we
bless your *exploration* of the powers of `rails generate` **do not use it** in
these challenges.  The ability to write Rails code (models, controllers, and
views) from a blank editor screen is a skill you need to develop.  An
interviewer will be none-too-impressed if your ability to write a controller is
hamstrung by access to the Rails generators.

**EXCEPTION**:  You may feel free to `rails generate migration`.  Why?  Because
figuring out time-stamps is irritating.

**EXCEPTION**:  You may also use the generators that are required to get RSpec
installed.  Why?  Because coordinating dependencies of a third-party gem that's
used for testing is difficult.


## Conclusion

- Don't burn out, take care of each other.
- This is a no-shame ask-anything environment.
- All our challenge solutions/repos should be under cohort organization.
- Make sure you review [Phase 3 Git Workflow](./git-workflow.md#phase-3-github-workflow) and [Group Project
Process](./group_project_process.md)
