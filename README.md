# Phase 3 guide

## Welcome to Phase 3

Welcome from your teachers.  Phase 3 is the most exciting
phase here at DBC.  In this phase we no longer view you as students or
developers-in-training, rather we look at you to be valuable, albeit junior,
collaborators in the craft of software development.  This will define how we
interact and how we assign and tackle challenges.  Similarly, and you should no
longer think of yourselves as "classmates" but rather "teammates" or
"coworkers."

### Student Handbook

The [student handbook](../../../student-handbook) has information about DBC's agreements, policies, and rules. Please review it.

### Counseling

- [Book a counseling session!](https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUtQaHJvRHgzX3U4fGRlZmF1bHR8Zjg1ZTQ3NmZhODQ1YTFhODcyMTczZDYwOGRmNTRhMWY)

## Daily Schedule

- Daily standup at 9 a.m.
  - Be on time, this will be an expectation upon graduation
  - Each person will answer **the three questions**
    - What you did yesterday (or, lessons learned from yesterday's challenges)
    - What you plan to do today
    - Any blockers
- Lectures
  - We will lecture around 9:15 and 2:00 daily
  - ...but we will ocassionally have surprise break-outs
  - ...and we may occasionally drop lectures if we think we'll be interrupting
    your flow
- Pace &amp; Schedule
  - I reserve the right to change the schedule and accelerate / collapse days depending on the pace of the cohort

## Challenges

- Daily standup at 9 a.m., each person will talk about what they've worked on yesterday (lessons learned from yesterday's challenges), what they're planing today and any blockers.
- Phase 3 will try to simulate more real world experiences, and you should no longer think of yourselves as classmates but rather teammates or coworkers.
- Challenges will be bigger and more vague. A lot of the problem will be how strategizing how to approach the problem: like debugging or researching a problem.
- The emphasis of challenges are on the process of problem solving, not the solution.
- Code quality is #1.
- Challenges will be bigger and more vague. A lot of the problem will be how strategizing how to approach the problem: like debugging or researching a problem.
- The emphasis of challenges is on the process of problem solving, not the
  solution.  _We expect that you can complete any challenge at this point.  HOW
you complete it is at stake_.

## Rails

Rails is a powerful tool.  While you've had to write and re-write the same
boilerplate code dozens of times in Sinatra skeleton, Rails will make it
**much** easier to get up and running and take the boilerplate away.

That said, Rails can become _too_ "zealous" in its code generation.  While we
bless your *exploration* of the powers of `rails generate` **do not use it** in
these challenges.  The ability to write Rails code (models, controllers, and
views) from a blank editor screen is a skill you need to develop.  An
interviewer will be none-too-impressed if your ability to write a controller is
hamstrung by access to the Rails generators.

**EXCEPTION**:  You may feel free to `rails generate migration`.  Why?  Because
figuring out time-stamps is irritating.

## Feedback

Don't be attached to your code, our job is to be critical and opinionated :)
Occasionally a criticism will be reducible to a question of style.  Both of us
are professional Rails developers.  We may occasionally give you guidance that
is justified by "that's not idiomatic Rails."  That's "taste" and while we hope
you have aquired some sense of it in the previous phases, we will try to help
you further refine it during our time together.

### On Feedback Style

In Phase 3, part of our goal is to debug your thought process.  If you say you
are weak, we will give you exercises.  If you give us a bad process, we will ask
you to find your own weakness.  If you criticise the challenges we give you, we
will make you fix them.  If you complain that something "doesn't work" we will
ask you to explain what you've done to understand the problem.

In short, we're going to ask you to be completely **responsible**.  Lamentably
this expectation seems to have gone out of fashion these days, but that is not
the case here.

## De Sententiis (On Opinions)

When someone gives you an observation, it is your obligation to hold them
accountable to that opinion.  When a coach comes along and says "ERB sucks,
HAML is the bomb" it is your **job** to ask that individiual:  "Wombat Salar,
why do you say this?  What problem does this solve?  What companies are using
this?  Who are the main contributors on this?  What's their philosophy?  What's
the point of view behind this thing?"

While it's important to leave your mind open for input, it's also important to
know when you need *not* heed some advice.  As Kipling says in "If:"

    If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
        But make allowance for their doubting too;...
    Yours is the Earth and everything thatâ€™s in it

## Review

We will do our best to pair with all of you several times throughout the phase.
We will be conducting code reviews for specific challenges. Some of these will
happen on github's pull requests and others will happen live, face to face.

## Questions

We are here to help.  Everyone who teaches at DBC has made a decision to use
their development talents and passion to help fuel that selfsame passion in
others.  We want you to ask _yourself_ first, _your pair_ second, _your peer_
third and a teacher _last_.

When engaging with any of these parties, most especially the first party, it is
absolutely paramount that you ask the question properly.  80% of the time a
question that would be asked of another or of a forum could be avoided entirely
if the asker had taken the time to formulate the question clearly with
expectations and proof.  Your teacher demands that you ask me focused,
targeted questions that indicate the strength and character of your mental
model.

An invaluable guide on asking questions can be found here:
[Asking Smart Questions by Eric Raymond](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

To be clear "asking a question" is not the same as "telling a story."  Telling
a story tells us what the user story or feature was that you're implementing.
Saying that the story's goal doesn't work is not a question.  It says you're
_en route_ to asking a question but you've not isolated the essential tripping
point that's preventing your story from having a happy ending.  Story-telling
is a great first step, but it is not the step where you should reach out for
help.

When you ask a question look for seams between "what I have here it what I
expect" and "what I get back is not what I expect".  That tunnel that takes the
"what you expect" and turns it into "what you didn't expect" is where your bug
is.  If your that tunnel, i.e. your code, is small and focused, your bug should
pop out.  If it is a snarl of spaghetti, it will be difficult to figure out.
We call this process "debugging."

Have log files, unit tests, etc. handy when you engage these peers and we will
be able to focus, solve, and move on.  If anyone asks for help but doesn't show
you the respect of formulating a question, you should feel proud in asking them
to formulate a clearer question for you.  All our time is precious and we
must all show each other due respect.
