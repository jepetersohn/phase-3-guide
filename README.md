# Phase 3 guide

## Overview:

- Daily standup at 9 a.m., each person will talk about what they've worked on yesterday (lessons learned from yesterday's challenges), what they're planing today and any blockers.
- Phase 3 will try to simulate more real world experiences, and you should no longer think of yourselves as classmates but rather teammates or coworkers.
- Challenges will be bigger and more vague. A lot of the problem will be how strategizing how to approach the problem: like debugging or researching a problem.
- The emphasis of challenges are on the process of problem solving, not the solution.
- Code quality is #1.
- Don't be attached to your code, my job is to be critical and opinionated :)
- I will do my best to pair with all of you several times throughout the phase.
- I will be conducting code reviews for specific challenges. Some of these will happen on github's pull requests and others will happen live, face to face.
- This is a no-shame ask anything environment.
- Don't burn out, take care of each other.
- All our challenge solutions/repos should be under phase organization.
- I'm always interruptible and so are you.

## Our github workflow:

- Clone the challenge repo.
- Create your own branch (github usernames separated by dashes)
- Your work should happen in a series of small and concise commit messages. Basically, your solution shouldn't be a 1 gigantic commit.
- Continuously push your branch to github.
- When you're satisfied with your solution, submit a pull request.
- We never ever ever push to master, like ever.
