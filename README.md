# Phase 3 guide

## Overview:

- Daily standup at 9 a.m., each person will talk about what they've worked on yesterday (lessons learned from yesterday's challenges), what they're planing today and any blockers.
- Phase 3 will try to simulate more real world experiences, and you should no longer think of yourselves as classmates but rather teammates or coworkers.
- Challenges will be bigger and more vague. A lot of the problem will be how strategizing how to approach the problem: like debugging or researching a problem.
- The emphasis of challenges are on the process of problem solving, not the solution.
- Code quality is #1.
- Do NOT use rails scaffold & rails generation. The only exception is Rails generate migration. Please don't generate models, don't generate controllers or views. We are learning to write code, don't let Rails write it for you. Besides, rails generate/scaffold commands generate a lot of crappy and unnecessary code.
- Don't be attached to your code, my job is to be critical and opinionated :)
- I will do my best to pair with all of you several times throughout the phase.
- I will be conducting code reviews for specific challenges. Some of these will happen on github's pull requests and others will happen live, face to face.
- This is a no-shame ask anything environment.
- Don't burn out, take care of each other.
- All our challenge solutions/repos should be under phase organization.
- I'm always interruptible and so are you.
