## Phase 3 Github Workflow

- Setup [global_gitignore](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files). Make sure you ignore database.yml file and log files.
- Clone the challenge repo.
- Create your own branch (github usernames separated by dashes) e.g. shadi-topher
- Your work should happen in a series of small and concise commit messages. Basically, your solution shouldn't be a 1 gigantic commit.
- Continuously push your branch to github.
- When you're satisfied with your solution, submit a pull request.
- We never ever ever push to master, like ever.
- We never ever ever submit a pull request with failing tests, like ever.
- All group projects must have [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) setup.
