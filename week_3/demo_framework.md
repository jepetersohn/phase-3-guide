# Demo skeleton 

**What's a demo?**

The demo will be you and your teammates standing up in front of DBC and a few employers.  You will show your app and have slides (power point, keynote, etc).  The presentation should last ~10 minutes with 5 minutes for questions from the audience.  You should brainstorm questions that might be asked and prepare your answers ahead of time as best you can.

**How to win at demo**

Any demo can work, but the one below is a ready-made good solution. This is intended to allow you to a) focus on your product more than the demo and b) get you practicing your pitch as soon as possible. Repetition is more important than planning. 

Before demo day, you should be able to do a complete runthrough in 10 minutes without stopping. To get there, *expect to do a minimum of five complete runthroughs with the full team.*

**Why we demo...**

1. To tell a story of *group process*, *technical proficiency* and *problem solving under pressure* that illustrates the skills an employer can expect of any Dev Bootcamp graduate. 

2. To show off the individual passions and interests that make for a good match with employers. 

3. To celebrate the progress you’ve made by showing off your best work yet. 

4. To inspire our fellow boots to reach farther than they ever thought they could. 

5. To get practice talking about software in front of people. 


**The schedule**

This is a proposal, not gospel. But you only have ~10m, so make a plan that reserves time for questions. 

* 30s Hello + Value Proposition 

* 30s Teaser 

* 1m Intros 

* 3m The Story 

* 1m The App 

* 4m Questions

Scheduled to end at ~10 to ~12 minutes (ask your instructors). Hard stop at 12-15 minutes. 

**:30 The Hello**

Hello and one sentence value proposition. 

* Goal: tell them what problem you solve.

* Goal: make the project memorable enough to talk about. "You're the food app."  

Example: *"Hi folks, we're OtterSauce, we make it possible to send a digital otter anywhere in the world. Here's our site..."*

**:30 The Teaser**

Show the best page. Or two. 

* Goal: Show just enough UI to make the audience interested in hearing about it. 

* Goal: DON’T TALK. SRSLY, SAVE IT FOR LATER. Pretend it’s a screen cast with funky house music. 

* Show, don’t tell. 

Example: *"We’re going to see more of that in a minute. But first let me introduce our team…"*

**1m The Introductions**

Introduce your teammates or each teammate can introduce themselves.  This should include the parts of the app they worked on. 

* Goal: Identify interests of individuals on the team: "I love UI..." “He’s a hardass about testing...” “She loves solving problems like...”

* Goal: Provide hooks to start conversations. Less "She’s good at XYZ" and more “She loves working on...” No one wins a demo; but good matches can happen. 

**4m The Story **

Tell a story about how you got to the product you shipped. Some example stories...

* *"We explored lots of different products that addressed this but ultimately decided that no one was doing this..."* (product story)

* *"We did this one thing, and the implementation was really interesting. This is why..." *(technology story) 

* "*Some of our early projects got really gnarly, so when we started, we really wanted our testing and source control to be rock solid..."* (process story) 

This story should have basic story arc:

* a challenge (*"we really want to build this thing..."*)

* a conflict (*"math is hard!"*)  

* a victory! (*"TDD sure did help and heeeere’s our site!"*)

Mandatory keyword dropping - this might come up naturally in your story, but if not, you should include a one to three sentence namecheck to 

* The keyword-level technology stack *"This is a Rails app using a mapping framework called Doucherocket and some custom JS. It’s hosted at Heroku, with location data on MapBox. The base map is from Open Street Map."* 

* The group methodology. *"We used TDD with Cucumber; We had hourly standups and morning scrums...".*

Keep your stack description keyword only - the goal is the start the next conversation, not explain everything. 

Use full screen images to help pace this section and remind you of order. Speak to an image, then hand off to a new speaker. We do not recommend lists, bullets, or powerpoint fluff. Repeat: avoid words on slides. Think 3 - 6 images per 5 minutes of talk. Images can be of prototypes, action shots (ie typing), whiteboards, etc. 

Getting into code examples is uncommon but likely to impress some. Be mindful of time; planning and practice helps with this. 

**1m The App**

You story should end with a happy outcome, which leads into the app. Things to remember:

* Know what you want to show, and show only that. Be quick. Be incomplete. If people want more, they can ask questions. 

* **_No surprises._** Lock your deployment down before practicing your demo, and know exactly what each button does. Test those links! 

* Seed your app with enough data to make it look like people actually use it. Plan time for this.

* Preloaded tabs vs localhost vs wifi? It’s up to you. In the real world, you’d probably run locally because wifi always breaks. In here, we kind of love seeing you run live. Stuff breaks, you fix it, everyone cheers. 

**4m Questions**

This is where DBC students shine. Get through the demo in order to preserve your question time.* Going to questions early is totally OK. *Here is a list of potential questions:

**Timing enforcement**

A helper will post your time on a whiteboard at 8m, 9m, 10m... until you get to questions. Make the transition to questions explicit. 

Example: *"That’s our demo, and we’re happy to answer questions." [applause] *

Once in questions, staff will call for "last question" etc to facilitate exit from the stage and keep you on time. **Don’t verbalize “We’re out of time,” just say thank you and end the demo. **

Example: "*So that’s OtterSauce, Thanks very much!" [applause]*

If you have not started questions at 12m we will shut you down regardless. Do not do that!
