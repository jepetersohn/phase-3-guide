# How to get a code review

I have forked your projects into my own Github account.

In your pull request, include:

* list of features in this pull request
* screenshots of new front-end features

1. Create a pull request from your cohort repository into my repository.
* You'll need to click edit in the top left corner of the pull request page.
* Set the **base fork** repository to your cohort organization's repository
* Set the **head fork** repository to MY fork of your repository.
