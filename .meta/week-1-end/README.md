# Weekend 1

Guidelines for things to communicate around weekend 1

## Friday

1.  Direction: Work on the weekend challenge
2.  Timebox: Decide how many hours you want to work on this
3.  Allot time to implement the [markdown-widget-challenge][mdwc] within the context of
    your [overflow challenge][ovflowc].  They should implement release "-1" of
    the markdown challenge, but for eager beavers, they can try to run the
    whole thing.  Emphasize that you encourage this stretch if they want to do
    a JS-heavy final project.
4.  Emphasize that they **should not** blow out their health and welfare
    for this project.  They need their health and wits for the FPs!
5.  Encourage them to focus on the Rails portion. While JS is good and has
    a place, the purpose of this challenge is to understand the core operation
    of a CGI framework.

## Sunday

1.  Send reminder about time for the widget
