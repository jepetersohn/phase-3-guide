Greetings,

Welcome to Phase III.  As your instructor(s) will further detail, we need to go
fast in this phase so that we can make the best final projects possible, as
well as prepare you for the job market.

In order to prepare yourselves for next week you will need to invest time this
weekend (~16-20 hours) to be at peak performance on next Monday.

1.  Type-along with [Cows on Rails](./cows_on_rails.md)
2.  Complete the [Build a Rails Blog](../../../../build-a-rails-blog) guided journey
3.  Migrate your Phase 2 audition into Rails

As an auxiliary source of information you may want to look at the
[intro-to-rails-challenge](../../../../intro-to-rails-challenge).  This
challenge is different in that it has several branches which you check out and
use to explore.  You will not create a branch or a pull request.  Rather,
through a series of branches you will be introduced in more painstaking detail
to the parts of the Rails framework.

As always, take notes and come to your Phase III instructors **hungry**.  It's
going to be an intense 8 instruction days before your final projects &mdash;
let's get cracking!

Your Phase III instructors
