# Final Presentations Topics

Here are the guidelines for the final projects pitching and process.

## Pitch

Students will get 1 minute to pitch on pitch day.

We will shuffle the array of students.  When called, a student may choose to
pitch or "pass."  Everyone, therefore is guaranteed one slot to pitch.

We will continue through the full list of students asking if they have
additional ideas to pitch until either: 1) the alotted time expires or 2)
everyone passes.  This will conclude the pitching activities.

## Narrowing

We will then narrow the ideas to the top contenders.  The number of contenders
will be determined by the size of the cohort, typically 4.  Students will be
presented a list of the projects.  For any and all projects the students
support, they may enter that project's number on a post it note.  As many
numbers as desired can be entered (without repetition).  After all ballots are
in, the teachers will tally votes.

## Presentation

The winning projects will be listed.
