## Learning Competencies

- Identify the benefits of wireframing

## Summary

Regardless of whether design is interesting to you or not, web design matters to end users of the website and business management.  It's important to know about so you can work more effectively with other teams in the organization.  On of the first steps in creating a web page is often to wireframe it. This process should also help you learn to separate different parts of a site (design vs. content, html vs. css, user interface vs. user experience) and learn the process of developing websites.


## Intro to Design Thinking

While designers may be "creative" or "artistic", they are also, like
software engineers, problem solvers.  They just solve problems visually
instead of with code.  For some of you, this may come really naturally;
for others it may not.  Either is OK.
