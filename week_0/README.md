# Week 0

We'll be kicking off Phase 3 by diving in to Rails (yes, finally!). Some parts of Rails will look similar to what you've been doing in Sinatra -- others won't. 

Here's your homework for this weekend:

* Go through "Rails the Sinatra Way" and "Rails the Rails Way": 
https://gist.github.com/keithtom/2956bfa3c603e21e6b6c
* Go through this intro to Rails: https://github.com/dontmitch/intro_to_rails
* If you find or know of other great introductory Rails resources, share them on your cohort mailing list
* Watch this presentation on TDD: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhwElTL-mdI
(Also, for extra credit convert it to a MOV and Dropbox it to the rest of us). Take markdown notes on the video and **share a link to your notes as a gist on this email thread**.

Then develop a Rails blog app, deploy it to Heroku. Issue a pull request to this guide adding the URL to your repo below. The Heroku URL should be included in the README file.

Good Hunting!
