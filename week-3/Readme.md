### Day 1 Final Project - MVP

This is your last day to ship big and risky features.  After today you should
be hedging back on risk. You want to start teeing up your final project demo.
Have you deployed to your deployment host?  If there's a big, risky feature,
today's the day to do it.

- am - Work on your project.
- 2p - EE / Journaling / Reflection (10m)
- pm - Work on your project.

### Day 2 Final Project - Consulting Day

If you start a new feature today it should be small and focused.  It should
have low risk (i.e. will not break the entire app).  It's also a good day to
hunt big bugs and to increase test coverage where it is weak.

### Day 3 Final Project - Wrap it up

Today is a refactor day.  Clean things up, add tests, make sure it works on the
platforms you care about, feel good about it.  Go home at a decent hour because
tomorrow we're going to work on the art of presentation.
