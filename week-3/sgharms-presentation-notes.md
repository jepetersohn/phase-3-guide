# Good Presentation

## The Imprortance of Presentation

* How many things do we take a whole day for at DBC: Roman Numerals, a day of
  working on a final project, etc.  It's a way of communicating "this is
  important."
* Jr. Engineer to Engineer to Sr. Engineer to Engineering Manager
  * Ability to present determines your career
  * Ability to present determines the fate of your group: you will literally
    control lives.
  * You need to learn to do this

## Practice

* Great presentations are practiced.  Over and over again.  And again.

## Stagecraft

Great presentations are exercises in stagecraft.  If you have a history in
dance, performance art, or etc. this is your time to really add something to a
team.

## Slidecraft

* Slides are not
  * Paragraphs
  * Web pages
  * They are auxiliary stopping points for talking about a story that lives
    **OUTSIDE** of the slides themselves

###  DO

  * Big text
  * Less of it
  * High contrast
  * Big pictures
  * Charts, not tables
  * Use a normal typeface with text at the top

## Code

  * Really, I meant it re: high contrast
  * Use a syntax highlighter
  * A screen-shot might be better than text
  * Diff views are great to show changes....to show the big pink and green.

### DO NOT (*Tai Chi* slave form)
  * Annoying animations

## Peeves
  * Don't show me login

## Reference
  * A successful 10 year corporate career
